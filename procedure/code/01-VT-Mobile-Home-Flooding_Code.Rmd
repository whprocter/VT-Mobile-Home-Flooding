# Abstract

Accurate assessment of risk is an essential for effective response to any natural disaster. The methodologies
used to assess risk can end up underestimating vulnerabilities. Tropical Storm Irene offers an example of
inadequate assessment of risk, which then leads to inadequate planning for and response to a disaster. The
storm inundated Vermont with unprecedented rainfall on August 28 and 29 of 2011. The storm destroyed
480 bridges and 960 culverts (where streams cross under a road), causing $350 million in road damage and
cutting off road access to 13 mountain communities. Even Vermont's emergency management offices were
flooded! Some of the most affected people were living in mobile homes, whether on individual parcels of
land or in mobile home parks. At least 130 mobile homes were destroyed and an additional 300 severely
damaged (Figure 1). Our problem will evaluate assessments of flooding risks with a focus on mobile homes
in Vermont.
There are two different ways of assessing flooding risk in Vermont: one is by the federal agency, FEMA
(The Federal Emergency Management Association), and one by a state agency, Vermont Rivers Program.
The federal agency, FEMA, estimates flood risk in terms of inundation from rising water levels in stable
river channels. Based on existing channels, FEMA hydrologists estimate the region of land that would be
potentially flooded by a 1% (100-year) flood. The residents with mortgages in that region are required to
purchase flood insurance.
The state of Vermontâ€™s River Corridors Program estimates flooding risk differently, using river corridors.
After Irene, the state of Vermont recognized that the most damaging flooding in Vermont is not due to
inundation but rather due to fluvial erosion: the erosion of riverbanks as the river channel widens or
migrates to form new channels (Figure 1 and Figure 2). By this estimation, regions where rivers may erode
and migrate to in the future are also at risk of flooding.

The research involved a spatial overlay analysis using existing and
newly created data sets to assess the vulnerability of mobile home
parks to flooding (Fig. 3). The analysis used a number of publicly
available data sets, including Vermont E911, a mobile home park
registry, FIRMs, and orthographic imagery.


This is a reproduction of a study that is taught in Middlebury College's Human Geography with GIS course, which itself builds on Baker et al's 2011 study on **Rapid Flood Exposure Assessment of Vermont Mobile Home Parks Following Tropical Storm Irene**

... same form as above...

## Prior observations  

Prior experience with the study area, prior data collection, or prior observation of the data can compromise the validity of a study, e.g. through p-hacking.
Therefore, disclose any prior experience or observations at the time of study pre-registration here, with example text below:

At the time of this study pre-registration, the authors had _____ prior knowledge of the geography of the study region with regards to the ____ phenomena to be studied.
This study is related to ____ prior studies by the authors

For each primary data source, declare the extent to which authors had already engaged with the data:

- [ ] no data collection has started
- [ ] pilot test data has been collected
- [ ] data collection is in progress and data has not been observed
- [ ] data collection is in progress and __% of data has been observed
- [ ] data collection is complete and data has been observed. Explain how authors have already manipulated / explored the data.

For each secondary source, declare the extent to which authors had already engaged with the data:

- [ ] data is not available yet
- [ ] data is available, but only metadata has been observed
- [ ] metadata and descriptive statistics have been observed
- [ ] metadata and a pilot test subset or sample of the full dataset have been observed
- [ ] the full dataset has been observed. Explain how authors have already manipulated / explored the data.

If pilot test data has been collected or acquired, describe how the researchers observed and analyzed the pilot test, and the extent to which the pilot test influenced the research design.

## Bias and threats to validity

Given the research design and primary data to be collected and/or secondary data to be used, discuss common threats to validity and the approach to mitigating those threats, with an emphasis on geographic threats to validity.

These include:
  - uneven primary data collection due to geographic inaccessibility or other constraints
  - multiple hypothesis testing
  - edge or boundary effects
  - the modifiable areal unit problem
  - nonstationarity
  - spatial dependence or autocorrelation
  - temporal dependence or autocorrelation
  - spatial scale dependency
  - spatial anisotropies
  - confusion of spatial and a-spatial causation
  - ecological fallacy
  - uncertainty e.g. from spatial disaggregation, anonymization, differential privacy

## Data transformations

Describe all data transformations planned to prepare data sources for analysis.
This section should explain with the fullest detail possible how to transform data from the **raw** state at the time of acquisition or observation, to the pre-processed **derived** state ready for the main analysis.
Including steps to check and mitigate sources of **bias** and **threats to validity**.
The method may anticipate **contingencies**, e.g. tests for normality and alternative decisions to make based on the results of the test.
More specifically, all the **geographic** and **variable** transformations required to prepare input data as described in the data and variables section above to match the study's spatio-temporal characteristics as described in the study metadata and study design sections.
Visual workflow diagrams may help communicate the methodology in this section.

Examples of **geographic** transformations include coordinate system transformations, aggregation, disaggregation, spatial interpolation, distance calculations, zonal statistics, etc.

Examples of **variable** transformations include standardization, normalization, constructed variables, imputation, classification, etc.

Be sure to include any steps planned to **exclude** observations with *missing* or *outlier* data, to **group** observations by *attribute* or *geographic* criteria, or to **impute** missing data or apply spatial or temporal **interpolation**.
